A set of experiments with CSS gradients.

# What is here? 

1.  Heat - imitates the sun against a blue sky.
2.  Eclipse - imitates a solar eclipse.
3.  Moonrise - a surreal purple moonrise.  
4.  Striped Gradient Generator - input a start and end color using hex values, and a number of stripes.  The gradient generator will create a gradient interrupted by white stripes.
